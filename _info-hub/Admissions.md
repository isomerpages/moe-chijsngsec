<u><b>Admission to Secondary 1</b></u> 

  

Primary 6 students intending to seek admission to CHIJ St. Nicholas Girls’ School may do so via the following channels: 

*   Secondary 1 Posting Exercise 
	 
	 The annual Secondary 1 Posting Exercise is conducted by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to post Primary 6 students from mainstream primary schools who have sat for the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) and are eligible for secondary school. The exercise takes into consideration the students’ PSLE results, choices of schools and availability of vacancies.  
For further information on the Secondary 1 Posting Exercise, please refer to the following website for details:

*   Direct School Admission-Secondary (DSA-Sec) Exercise. 


	Direct School Admission for secondary schools allows students to apply to some secondary schools before taking their PSLE. Students apply based on their talent in sports, CCAs and specific academic areas. Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.
