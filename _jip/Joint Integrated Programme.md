#### **Overview**

Over generations, Catholic High School, CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School and Singapore Chinese Girls’ School have developed many leaders across extensive fields whose significant contributions have transformed our society. We continue this legacy of excellence together with Eunoia Junior College, through the Joint Integrated Programme (JIP).&nbsp;

The JIP is not merely a programme but a community anchored by a strong culture of care for every student.&nbsp; With more than 250 years of experience in education between the four schools, as well as extensive alumni networks spanning diverse fields, the JIP is well-poised to provide an enriching and relevant curriculum that stretches students’ potential with customised learning opportunities and equip them with the knowledge, skills and dispositions to be future-ready, as Principled Leaders of Tomorrow.

#### **The JIP Approach and the JIP Graduate**

<u>The JIP Approach</u>

The JIP approach for developing and nurturing Principled Leaders of Tomorrow consists of the three key pillars of&nbsp;**(1) Cognitive development, (2) Character development and (3) Leadership development.**&nbsp;The outer portion of the diagram shows the desired outcomes, in terms of  knowledge, skills and attitudes, embodied by our graduates.

This approach is helmed by our team of dedicated and highly qualified professionals who ensure that students learn in a vibrant environment with state-of-the-art facilities. Unique to the JIP, our flagship World Readiness Programme and Passion Pursuit challenges students to examine world issues, consider multiple perspectives, seek opportunities beyond problems and embrace possibilities beyond risks. By providing a variety of learning experiences, including exciting collaborations with the larger community, students are empowered to find and hone diverse talents alongside like-minded peers. Voices are nurtured, self-confidence raised and curiosity piqued such that students are empowered to discover their passion for life and inspired them to make learning a lifelong endeavour.
