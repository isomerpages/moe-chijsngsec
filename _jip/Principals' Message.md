##### **Principals' Message**

Dear Parents and Students,

Over generations, Catholic High School, CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School and Singapore Chinese Girls’ School have developed many leaders across extensive fields whose significant contributions have transformed our society. We continue this legacy of excellence together with Eunoia Junior College, through the Joint Integrated Programme (JIP).  Since the inception of the JIP in 2013, we have reached a milestone in our decade-long journey, having established a distinctive programming and strengthened the JIP experience. 

When you choose the JIP, you join a community anchored by a strong culture of care for every student.  With more than 250 years of experience in education between us, as well as extensive alumni networks spanning diverse fields, the JIP is well-poised to provide an enriching and relevant curriculum that recognises students as individuals and stretches their potential with customised learning opportunities that will equip them to be future-ready. 

Our flagship World Readiness Programme challenges our students to examine world issues, consider multiple perspectives, seek opportunities beyond problems and embrace possibilities beyond risks. Student voice is nurtured, self-confidence raised and curiosity piqued through Passion Pursuit, another of our flagship programmes.  Surrounded by like-minded peers, our students’ learning is further enriched by the diversity of experiences offered across the JIP schools: a unique feature of the JIP. 

Behind every self-directed learner is a team of highly qualified professionals that is dedicated to enriching your child’s experience in our schools. OUr students learn in a vibrant environment with state-of-the-art facilities.  Exciting collaborations with the larger community enhance our students’ JIP experience.  We are confident that the JIP experience will empower students to discover their passion for life, and inspire them to make learning a lifelong endeavour. 

The JIP graduate is one who is anchored by strong values, and driven by a deep sense of purpose to contribute meaningfully to society.  As a Principled Leader of Tomorrow, he or she possesses strength of character, a heart for service, with the spirit of wisdom and courage to chart tomorrow as leaders of their generation. This is the hallmark of our JIP graduates. 

The future holds many exciting opportunities. If you would like to embark on this journey with the JIP, we invite you to read on. Join us in transforming the future, today.
