##### **The JIP Curriculum**

In the JIP, students immerse themselves in an enriching, extensive and authentic six-year learning experience that effectively equips them to explore and further develop their personal strengths, passions and talents.

JIP students from Catholic High School (CHS), CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School (SNGS) and Singapore Chinese Girls’ School (SCGS) will spend their first four years in their respective secondary schools before progressing to EJC and can look forward to the following Ministry of Education (MOE) special programmes that are tailor-made to cater to their learning passions and aspirations.  From Year 3, JIP students can offer the Bicultural Studies Programme, which is also offered in EJC.
