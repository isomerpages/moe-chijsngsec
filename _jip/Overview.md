##### **Overview**

Over generations, Catholic High School, CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School and Singapore Chinese Girls’ School have developed many leaders across extensive fields whose significant contributions have transformed our society. We continue this legacy of excellence together with Eunoia Junior College, through the Joint Integrated Programme (JIP). 

The JIP is not merely a programme but a community anchored by a strong culture of care for every student.  With more than 250 years of experience in education between the four schools, as well as extensive alumni networks spanning diverse fields, the JIP is well-poised to provide an enriching and relevant curriculum that stretches students’ potential with customised learning opportunities and equip them with the knowledge, skills and dispositions to be future-ready, as Principled Leaders of Tomorrow.
