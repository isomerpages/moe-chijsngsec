##### **World Readiness Programme**

*Beyond the Core Academic Programme, our unique World Readiness Programme (WRP) aims to develop our students’ ability to impact lives in positive, ethical and meaningful ways. The WRP prepares our students for the world by elevating them beyond the classroom and equipping them to understand Singapore’s role in the international arena. This programme will also give them exposure to both Eastern and Western perspectives of geopolitical, social, cultural, economic and technological issues and megatrends to give our students the edge as they step up onto the global stage.*

<u>Curriculum</u>

From Years 1 to 4, modules offered under Philosophy of Knowledge and Emerging Asia ride on the existing strengths of our schools in nurturing bilingual and bicultural students. They also develop our JIP students to be well-versed in eastern and western perspectives on knowledge, reason and values. In turn, the Current Affairs modules are designed to promote an understanding of global issues and megatrends.

From Years 1 to 4, the knowledge that our JIP students acquire in WRP will provide them with the foundational knowledge and skills that will put them in good stead for specific subjects and special programmes offered at EJC.

The WRP utilises a variety of learning platforms to engage students. In addition to lectures and tutorials in each school schools also engage or participate in programmes organized by external agencies (e.g. participation in Model United Nations Conferences).&nbsp; The three partner secondary schools also collaboratively organise annual WRP Symposiums where students are brought together to benefit from the synergistic sharing of ideas and perspectives.&nbsp; At these WRP Symposiums, our students interact with people across a broad spectrum of society, including research engineers, foreign diplomats, social entrepreneurs and thought leaders.
