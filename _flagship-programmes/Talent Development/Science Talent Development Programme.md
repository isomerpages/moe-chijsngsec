As part of their development, STDP students can look forward to participation in the following:  

**Science Mentorship Programme / A*STAR Research Exposure Programme / Science Research Programme**

* Working in group of 3-4, students are closely mentored by school/external mentors (university professors, researchers and scientists) on a research project of their interest
* Mentors will help provide insight into research work and develop students’ research skills and methodology
* Programmes are conducted after school curriculum hours and venues may include local university campuses

**Science Olympiad Training**

* 12-15 hours of training for the Chemistry, Physics and/or Biology Olympiad will conducted after school for selected students
* Students will subsequently participate in the Singapore Junior Physics Olympiad, the Singapore Junior Chemistry Olympiad and/or the Singapore Junior Biology Olympiad

**External opportunities : Forums, seminars, conferences, attachment, competitions and camps**

* Students are given opportunities to broaden their exposure and apply their knowledge through participation in external Forums, Competitions, Conferences and Camps such as the International Science Youth Forum, the Young Defence Science Programme Science & Technology Camp, and the National Science Challenge
