<p>The Music Elective Programme (MEP) is a four-year programme which provides
opportunities for musically-inclined students to pursue a deeper study
and practice in music. Through the programme, students will have the opportunity
to learn more about a range of music across genres and cultures, including
Asian, Classical, Jazz and Popular Music.</p>
<p>Students selected for the programme will be equipped with skills for music
analysis, aural perception, composition and performance. They will share
rich classroom experiences aimed at nurturing a deeper appreciation of
music with like-minded peers, and be offered exciting opportunities such
as interaction with composers, master classes and workshops, in order to
deepen their learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The programme prepares students for the GCE ‘O’ Level Higher Music Examination,
which can be considered in place of a Humanities subject for Junior College
admission.&nbsp;</p>
