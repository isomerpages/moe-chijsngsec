<h3><strong>The Music Elective Programme (MEP)</strong></h3>
<p>The Music Elective Programme (MEP) is a four-year programme which provides
opportunities for musically-inclined students to pursue a deeper study
and practice in Music. Through the programme, students will have the opportunity
to learn more about a range of music across genres and cultures, including
Asian, Classical, Jazz and Popular Music.</p>
<p>Students selected for the programme will be equipped with skills for music
analysis, aural perception, composition and performance. They will share
rich classroom experiences aimed at nurturing a deeper appreciation of
music with like-minded peers, and be offered exciting opportunities such
as interaction with composers, master classes and workshops, in order to
deepen their learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The programme prepares students for the Secondary Education Certificate
(SEC) Higher Music Examination, which can be considered in place of a Humanities
subject for Junior College admission.&nbsp;</p>
