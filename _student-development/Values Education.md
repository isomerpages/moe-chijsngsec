1.  Character and Values Education underpin the school curriculum, consistent with the school vision of ‘Girls with Grace, Women with Strength and Leaders with Heart’. Our school values are being explicitly taught in the formal and informal curriculum, guiding and providing the purpose for our students’ right behaviours. Platforms are purposefully put in place to develop 21CC skills such as Civic-Literacy, Global Awareness & Cross-Cultural Skills; Critical and inventive thinking; Communication, Collaboration and Information skills among our girls.   
      
    
2.  Lessons and narratives on the IJ and school’s history and ethos are infused in the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) and Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) curriculum, as well as during assemblies and school events.   
      
    The CCE curriculum is based on CCE lessons from MOE, which incorporates modules for VIA, Cyber Wellness, Sexuality Education and Education & Career Guidance, dedicated to imparting values and life skills to students. Resources from the Civics and Moral Education for Catholic Schools (CMECS) package from the Archdiocesan Commission for Catholic Schools (ACCS) are also used to complement MOE’s CCE lesson packages.
