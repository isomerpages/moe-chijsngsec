National Education
==================


<img src="/images/NE%20Curriculum%20Framework.png" style="width:70%">


<b>Our National Education Curriculum Framework</b>  
In alignment with the school vision, our students are engaged in a curriculum that embodies the objectives of Citizenship Education while portraying the need for the students to center themselves through the moral compass guided by “<b>Truth</b>, <b>Justice</b>, <b>Freedom</b> and <b>Love</b>”. The Citizenship curriculum aims to engage the “<b>Head</b>, <b>Hearts</b> and <b>Hands</b>” of our students through the activities and events outlined in the outermost ring of framework.   
  
In engaging the “<b>Head</b>”, lesson packages on contemporary issues and current affairs are implemented in the classroom during CCE lessons on a timely basis. Different perspectives are discussed through CCE Buzz sessions. By engaging our students in civic discourse, we aim to heighten their civic-literacy as well as build confidence in their ability to voice their opinions. Nuggets of information and activities are also planned by our NE ambassadors to expose our students about different faiths and festivals such as Pongal festival and Hari Raya Puasa.   
  
2019 was also the year when we inaugurated the Sec 3 NRIC Citizenship Ceremony. This session aimed to inculcate the importance of Citizenship as well as educating the students about the rights and privileges which citizens enjoy in a country. The girls learn that as part of maintaining their citizenship rights, they also have to exercise responsibility as citizens, for example, to vote.   
  
The Character Education Committee and National Committee work in tandem to lay out the fundamental structures of the various programmes that allow staff to shape our students’ exposure significantly both at local and global levels. Students also ride on the vast opportunities made available by our synergistic stakeholders to deepen their knowledge and enhance their experience.
