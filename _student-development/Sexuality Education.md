<h3><strong>Sexuality Education</strong></h3>
<p><strong>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools</strong> 
<br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sexuality Education (SEd)
in schools aims to enable students to understand the physiological, social
and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and
rewarding relationships with others, including those with members of the
opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality
matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the family as the basic unit
of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and
stable nuclear family units with extended family support. The teaching
and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and beliefs of the
different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Goals</strong> of Sexuality
Education are to:
<br>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Support students in managing their physiological, social and emotional
changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships.
<br>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality
matters.
<br>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help students
develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and others by having
positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality that are premised
on the family as the basic unit of society.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of
Sexuality Education are to:
<br>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love
and respect yourself as you love and respect others;
<br>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Build
positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the foundation
for strong families);
<br>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make responsible
decisions for yourself, your family and society; and
<br>(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstinence
before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and unintended
pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved ones.

<p><strong>Overview of CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School (Sec) Sexuality Education Programme for 2023</strong>
</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education is delivered
in a holistic manner through the school curriculum.&nbsp;The content for
Sexuality Education is grouped into five main themes: Human Development,
Interpersonal Relationships, Sexual Health, Sexual Behaviour, and, Culture,
Society and Law. You may click&nbsp;<a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-sexuality-education-scope" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;for
more information on the scope of Sexuality Education in the school curriculum.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The subjects that incorporate topics
on sexuality include:
<br>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Science
<br>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</p>
<p><strong>Sexuality Education Lessons</strong> 
<br>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The values and attitudes of our
youth towards sexuality are increasingly shaped by their peers, exposure
to the media, popular culture and the internet. Adolescence is a complex
stage in life as the adolescent attempts to find his/her own identity and
often struggles with new social relationships. The period of middle adolescence
(generally from 15 – 17 years old) can be a turbulent period for adolescents.
The gap between physical and emotional/cognitive maturity may result in
a tendency to act on impulse, experiment with various activities (including
sexual activities), sometimes without understanding the unpleasant consequences
that may arise from such experimentation. The need for peer acceptance
can be overwhelmingly strong, and hinder one’s ability to act responsibly.&nbsp;
Given the pressures faced by the middle adolescent from within themselves
and from peers, it is important to build a strong sense of self-worth,
personal conviction and an understanding of the possible consequences of
sexual behaviour.
<br>
<br>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the Sexuality Education
lessons, secondary students will have the opportunity to develop a positive
self-esteem, develop their character, and expand their understanding and
repertoire of skills to deal with various issues related to sexuality,
which are of prime concern at this age.</p>
<p><strong>At CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School (Sec), the following Sexuality Education lessons will be taught in 2024</strong>

<p><strong><em>eTeens</em> Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>eTeens</em>&nbsp;is a
programme developed by Health Promotion Board, in collaboration with the
Ministry of Education, to provide Secondary 3 students with accurate information
on STIs, HIV and protection from a health perspective.&nbsp;<em>eTeens</em>&nbsp;is
conducted in two segments – a mass talk segment and a classroom-based programme.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are taught skills such
as decision-making, assertiveness and negotiation to say “no” to sex and
negative peer pressure. They also learn that the impact of STIs/HIV extends
beyond themselves and involves their family. Abstinence and upholding family
values are the key messages.&nbsp;The desired outcome of the&nbsp;<em>eTeens</em> programme
is that students are empowered to make wise, informed and sensible decisions.</p>
<p><strong>At CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School, the&nbsp;<em>eTeens</em>&nbsp;programme will be implemented as follows in 2023:</strong>
