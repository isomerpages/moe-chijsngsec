<h3><strong>Values in Action</strong></h3>
<h5><strong>Values in Education: Shaping Character through Community Engagement</strong></h5>
<p>Consistent with the IJ Mission to reach and meet the needs of the less
privileged in the community, the school’s approach to VIA is “service by
all for all”. Through a differentiated VIA programme, students develop
empathy and responsibility, contributing meaningfully to their communities
in line with the school’s vision, ‘Girls of Grace, Women of Strength, Leaders
with Heart’.</p>

<p><strong>Lower Secondary Values-in-Action (VIA) Programme</strong>&nbsp;
<br>The Lower Secondary VIA programme nurtures socially responsible citizens
through meaningful community service activities. Students will step out
of their comfort zones to engage in initiatives that focus on the elderly
and the environment, such as visits to Active Ageing Centres and neighborhood
clean-up efforts. Partnering with organisations such as Christalite Methodist
Home and Hospice Care Association.
<br>
<br>Building on the foundation laid during Primary School, the Lower Secondary
VIA programme continues to develop students' character and leadership skills.
Students actively plan and organise their outreach activities, fostering
ownership and responsibility. Reflection sessions enable students to help
students deepen their understanding and appreciation of the communities
they serve.</p>
<p><strong>Upper Secondary Values-in-Action (VIA) Programme</strong>
<br>In Upper Secondary, students take the lead in planning and executing self-initiated
VIA projects with a Service-Learning (SL) focus. VIA activities for Secondary
3 and 4 students are categorised into Interactive and Non-interactive,
with a yearly cap of six hours for non-interactive activities to encourage
meaningful engagement.
<br>
<br>Drawing on the principles of Design Thinking, Catholic Social Teaching
(CST), and relevant United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs),
students apply innovative problem-solving, ethical decision-making, and
a global perspective to address real-world community needs. Past projects
have supported organisations such as the Singapore Children’s Society,
Association for People with Special Needs (APSN), Thye Hua Kwan Seniors
Activity Centre, and Children’s Cancer Foundation, among others. These
engagements provide students with invaluable opportunities to internalise
values of empathy, compassion, and active citizenship.</p>
