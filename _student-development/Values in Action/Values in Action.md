### **Values in Action**
##### ****Values in Education: Shaping Character through Community Engagement****

Consistent with the IJ Mission to reach and meet the needs of the less privileged in the community, the school’s approach to VIA is “service by all for all”. Through a differentiated VIA programme, students develop empathy and responsibility, contributing meaningfully to their communities in line with the school’s vision, ‘Girls of Grace, Women of Strength, Leaders with Heart’.

<b>Lower Secondary Values-in-Action (VIA) Programme</b>&nbsp;  
The Lower Secondary VIA programme nurtures socially responsible citizens through meaningful community service activities. Students will step out of their comfort zones to engage in initiatives that focus on the elderly and the environment, such as visits to Active Ageing Centres and neighborhood clean-up efforts. Partnering with organisations such as Christalite Methodist Home and Hospice Care Association.<br><br>
Building on the foundation laid during Primary School, the Lower Secondary VIA programme continues to develop students' character and leadership skills. Students actively plan and organise their outreach activities, fostering ownership and responsibility. Reflection sessions enable students to help students deepen their understanding and appreciation of the communities they serve.
  
<b>Upper Secondary Values-in-Action (VIA) Programme</b>  
In Upper Secondary, students take the lead in planning and executing self-initiated VIA projects with a Service-Learning (SL) focus. VIA activities for Secondary 3 and 4 students are categorised into Interactive and Non-interactive, with a yearly cap of six hours for non-interactive activities to encourage meaningful engagement.<br><br>
Drawing on the principles of Design Thinking, Catholic Social Teaching (CST), and relevant United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs), students apply innovative problem-solving, ethical decision-making, and a global perspective to address real-world community needs. Past projects have supported organisations such as the Singapore Children’s Society, Association for People with Special Needs (APSN), Thye Hua Kwan Seniors Activity Centre, and Children’s Cancer Foundation, among others. These engagements provide students with invaluable opportunities to internalise values of empathy, compassion, and active citizenship.
