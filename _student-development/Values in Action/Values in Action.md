<b>Lower Secondary Values-in-Action (VIA) Programme</b>   
Lower-Secondary students extend their services to meet community needs, specifically those of the elderly and the environment. In these two years, students will step out of the comfort zone of school to extend their services to the community through activities such as visits to Homes and Seniors Day-Care Centres, as well as helping to clean our neighbourhood and community. These activities are organised by the school in partnership with our community partners such as Christalite Methodist Home, Hospice Care Association and North-West CDC.   
  
Lower Secondary VIA continues the journey of students from their Primary schools to develop our students in character and leadership excellence. To this end, students are guided and facilitated to plan and organise their outreach activities before embarking on them. before they embark on any of their outreach activities. At the end of each activity, students will do personal reflections to enable them to deepen their understanding and appreciation of the communities that they have interacted with.  
  
<b>Upper Secondary Values-in-Action (VIA) Programme</b>  
Having been involved in various types of Values-in-action programmes from P1 to Sec 2, students in the upper secondary levels will take the initiative and responsibility to source for their own VIA activities. VIA at Sec 3 and Sec 4 is self-directed. This is in line with the school vision, ‘Girls of Grace, Women of Strength, Leaders with Heart’.  
  
Student-initiated VIA activities for Sec 3 and Sec 4, are classified into 2 main groups, namely, Non-interactive and Interactive. The school has set a cap of 6 hours for non-interactive activities within a year. The rationale is to encourage the students to be involved in a range of activities by reaching out to the community at large as well as to give them the opportunity to develop various life skills.   
  
Secondary Three students are to be involved in VIA projects that take on a service-learning (S-L) focus and process, which will in turn help them to internalise values of empathy and compassion as they plan out meaningful projects that are designed to meet the needs of less privileged. They will go through lessons during their Character and Citizenship (CCE) lessons, which will help them to understand the concept of organising programmes that would meet the needs of the segment of society that they would choose to help out. Regular reflection sessions - at the beginning, the middle and the end of their project - also help towards consolidating their learning. Organisations that have benefitted from these S-L projects include the Singapore Children’s Society, Association for People with Special Needs (APSN), Thye Hua Kwan Seniors Activity Centre, SMRT Corporation, Waterways Watch Society, NParks, Children’s Cancer Foundation, Breast Cancer Foundation, community child-care services such as IJ Homes and Children’s Centre and various Family Service Centres.   
  
The Secondary Four students get involved in community activities such as fund-raising, through flag days for organisations such as Society for the Physically Disabled, Infant Jesus Homes and Children’s Centres and various other non-profit organisations. They also help out in activities at the various libraries, and visits to elderly centres.
