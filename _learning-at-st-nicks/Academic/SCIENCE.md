<b>Our Philosophy</b>   

We strive to nurture students to be a concerned citizen with an inquiring mind, to be able to think critically and creatively and contribute to an increasingly technologically-driven world.   
We seek to develop scientific literacy to enable understanding of the nature of Science and its relationship to society, thus providing an education that goes beyond the mere teaching of the basic concepts of Science.   
  
<b>Our Approach</b>     

“Let curiosity lead the way”. We aim to inculcate a spirit of scientific inquiry as students engage in meaningful and enjoyable learning within and beyond the classroom. Through authentic learning experiences, students apply the skills and processes of inquiry and develop attitudes and values that are essential to the practice of Science.   
Students are exposed to a wide range of experiential opportunities where they can explore and experiment, thus, enriching their learning and enabling them to acquire knowledge and a better understanding of their natural and physical world. These opportunities also serve as platforms for them to pursue their passions and to cultivate a deeper interest in Science.   
  
  
<b>Our Signature Programmes</b>      

*   Secondary 1 MacRitchie Interdisciplinary Project  
    The Secondary 1 MacRitchie Interdisciplinary project seeks to provide an authentic learning experience, engaging students in experiential learning of Mathematics, Science and Geography. It provides opportunities for the students to carry out scientific investigation of water quality using a test kit, data logger and the live tracking of results. The students will learn to be a concerned and responsible citizen as they unpack the problem of water scarcity in Singapore and examine the effectiveness of measures in ensuring sustainability of water in Singapore.  
      
    
*   Secondary 2 Science Investigative Project  
    The Secondary 2 Science Investigative Project is an essential part of the Science curriculum to deepen students’ process and research skills. Students are given opportunities to explore and investigate the world around them, and to become independent, creative and critical learners.  
    The students will work in groups to initiate and design scientific investigation under the guidance of their assigned Science teachers as their mentors.  
    The assessment will focus on both the process and product of the project through the submission of their final research report, 15-min group presentation and individual Q&A and peer evaluation.  
    The outstanding projects will be submitted for the Elementz Science Competition and the A\*STAR East Zone Science Competition.  
      
    
*   Secondary 3 Expanding Your Horizons Science Conference  
    This conference is an annual event for all Secondary 3 students. It aims to deepen the interest of students in Science, raise their awareness of Science and its relevance to life, and provide opportunities for students to meet and interact with positive role models who are active in science-related careers.  
    It includes talks, hands-on activities and exhibition booths put up by various local organisations which contribute to the various aspects of Science, Technology and Innovation. The event also features an Amazing Race Challenge.  
      
    
*   Singapore Junior Physics, Biology, Chemistry Olympiad Training  
    The Olympiad training seeks to develop students who have the passion and desire to pursue Science in greater depth and exposure. Students are given opportunities to learn beyond the scope of the O-level Sciences to further develop scientific knowledge and skills.  
      
    
*   Passion Pursuit Modules  
    Our Passion Pursuit modules include: A Day at the Museum, Science behind Crime Scene Investigations, Pharmaceutical Science and Aromachemistry, astronomy and food gastronomy. These broad based enrichment programmes strive to provide students with the opportunities to pursue their areas of passion, cultivate other areas of interest and enrich their learning.
