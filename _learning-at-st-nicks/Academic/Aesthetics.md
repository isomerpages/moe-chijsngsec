<b>Our Philosophy</b>  

Aesthetics for All.  
  
We strive to provide opportunities, deepen appreciation and ignite the passion for Aesthetics.  
  
<b>Our Approach</b>  
  
The school’s Aesthetics programme is guided by the 3-E approach – Exposure, Experience and Excellence  
  
<b>Exposure</b> – All students are exposed to the Aesthetics via formal curriculum and informal curriculum such as school-wide Aesthetics Week and Arts programme. Students will also be given the platform to further express their aesthetics creativity through various forms of performances.  
  
<b>Experience</b> – Students with a deeper interest in the Aesthetics are provided with opportunities to further enhance their experiences in the arts, participating in Visual and Performing Arts CCAs and community arts events. In pursuing their interests, students are also given the opportunities to choose Passion Pursuit modules.  
  
<b>Excellence</b> – The school provides opportunities for our students to maximise their potential in the respective Aesthetics areas after talent identification is done, such as participation in various in-house, local and international competitions and showcase opportunities. Students are also provided with the opportunities to offer Art and Music as ‘O’ level subjects. The school’s strength in the arts is evident as it is one of the 11 schools in Singapore to offer the Music Elective Programme.  
  
<b>Our Signature Programmes</b>
