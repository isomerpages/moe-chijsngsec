<b>Our Philosophy</b>  

In the 21st Century, Mathematics is becoming increasingly pervasive in everyday life and is the foundation to almost all the sciences and engineering. It is a language by which we model and solve real world problems and appreciate order and symmetries in nature. We believe that a good foundation in Mathematics is essential for any future studies or work, and the learning of Mathematics is a training of the student’s mind in thinking and reasoning while seeking for the truth. We strive to build confidence and passion in learning Mathematics in our students. We aim for our students to be able to apply Mathematics in their daily lives, and cultivate an appreciation of the breadth, depth, beauty and powers of mathematics.  
  
<b>Our Approach</b>  
  
Logical thinking and analytical ability are critical 21st Century competencies. Students apply these skills to a wide range of real life context problems to cultivate an appreciation of how Mathematics underpins many aspects of their daily activities. Students will have the opportunity to develop problem-solving and interdisciplinary skills through project work. Students with a strong passion in Mathematics can participate in Passion Pursuit modules and competitions. These are platforms for students to be exposed to different aspects of Mathematics, as well as opportunities for them to delve deeper and challenge themselves further.  
  
<b>Our Signature Programmes</b>  
  

*     
    Secondary 1 Mathematics Enrichment

  
The programme aims to develop creativity, cognitive flexibility and problem solving skills. Students will also acquire the necessary Mathematical knowledge and skills for Mathematical Olympiads.  
  

*     
    Secondary 1 MacRitchie Project (Interdisciplinary Project Work)

  
This integrated project aims to infuse concepts from Mathematics, Science and Geography, and promote students’ learning via field investigation, scientific inquiry, Mathematical modeling and Polya’s problem-solving process.  
  Level: Sec 1   
  Time Period: Term 1 to Term 3   
  Offered by: Science, Mathematics and Humanities Departments  
  
  

*   Innovation Program (IvP)

  
The Innovation Programme (IvP) provides a unique opportunity for pupils to develop their problem-solving and thinking skills. At the end of the programme, pupils will be able to think critically about existing problems, generate ideas to improve the situation, develop prototypes to test and improve their ideas, be exposed to knowledge and experiences beyond the classroom through interaction with innovation mentors from tertiary institutions and other organisations.  
  Level: Sec 2 to 3  
  Time Period: Term 1 to Term 3  
  Offered by: Science and Mathematics Department   
  

*   Singapore Mathematics Society Project Festival  
    

  
The Singapore Mathematics Society Project Festival encourages secondary school students in Singapore to carry out and present innovative and creative work in Mathematics, foregrounding the importance of project-based learning in the secondary school curriculum. The festival features selected Mathematical projects completed by secondary school students in the year preceding submission.
