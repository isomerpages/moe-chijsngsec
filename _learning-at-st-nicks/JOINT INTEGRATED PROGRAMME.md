<b>Introduction</b>
  
The Joint Integrated Programme (JIP) by CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School (SNGS) is jointly offered in collaboration with Catholic High School (CHS), Singapore Chinese Girls’ School (SCGS) and Eunoia Junior College (EJC).   
  
Our JIP is a community anchored by a strong culture of care, and integrated and extends from the best elements of our schools. Our students experience a broad-based and enriched curriculum with opportunities to engage in a wide spectrum of authentic and future‐oriented learning experiences that will equip them with competencies to navigate in a complex world. JIP students from CHIJ SNGS, CHS and SCGS will spend their first four years in their respective secondary schools before progressing to EJC.
