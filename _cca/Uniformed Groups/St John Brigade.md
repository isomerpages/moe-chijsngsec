#### **St John Brigade**

<img src="/images/06%20CCA/UG%20St%20John/Picture1.jpg" style="width:75%">

St John Brigade (SJB) Singapore seeks to instil self-discipline in students and to promote teamwork among students.&nbsp;  
  
Students will learn basic first aid knowledge, which includes Home Nursing and Basic/Advanced CPR techniques. They will also engage in vigorous foot-drill and physical training sessions to build up their stamina. Students then apply the skills learnt in Zonal and National Competitions, which are held every year.  
  
Our motto is&nbsp;_Pro Utilitate Hominum_&nbsp;(For The Service of Mankind) and this is instilled in the cadets as they engage in Public Duty services, where they apply their practical skills into real-world context. Our cadets have provided first aid and relief efforts at numerous school events as well as various national platforms.&nbsp;  
  
<b>The St John Pledge</b>:  
  
<i>To be loyal to Singapore and the President of the Republic&nbsp;  
To upkeep the honour and dignity of the Brigade and my Country&nbsp;  
To observe the mottoes of the Order, which are "Pro Fide" – For the Faith, "Pro Utilitate Hominum" – For the Service of Mankind&nbsp;  
To be loyal to the Chief Commissioner and all my Officers&nbsp;  
To read the Brigade Regulations and to comply with them in all respects&nbsp;  
To carry out all orders received from time to time from seniors&nbsp;  
To carry out my duties with zeal and efficiency to the best of my ability&nbsp;  
To be courteous and honest in all my words and actions</i>
