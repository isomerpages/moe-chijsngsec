Girl Guides @ SN aims to prepare guides to handle challenges and new situations with a sense of confidence and self-assuredness. Through the 5-Point Programme and various proficiency/interest badges, guides are able to develop their leadership, decision-making and team-building skills.

<b>Guide Motto:</b><br>Be Prepared  
  
<b>Guide Promise:</b><br>
I promise to do my best;  
To do my duty to God,  
To serve my country and help other people, and  
To keep the Guide Law

It is also a time where Guides look forward to every year for activities like outdoor cooking, Kim’s games and campfire.

This year we collaborated with NPCC and SJB for our first Inter-UG camp.</td>
