Other than being a ‘paradise’ for our librarians and students, Library Society strives to spread the joy of reading amongst our 姐妹们, and to hone our librarians’ confidence and other soft skills with various public speaking opportunities, group projects, competitions and presentations.

2023 was a year full of fun and excitement as our librarians embarked on various CCA highlights- Virtual Escape Room for Mother Tongue Language Fortnight, book recommendations for English Language and Literature Festival (ELLF) based on the theme of ‘Weird and Wonderful’ on Instagram, and an exciting journey to discover the Truth in Libraries through the workshops and a learning journey by The Little Entrepreneur. Librarians also attended other workshops like ‘Finding Poems in Trash and Trees’ a creative writing workshop by local author - Dr Ann Ang, as well as a scrapbooking workshop where our librarians got to try making their own personal scrapbooks. We also explored ‘Women authors’ this year and had discussions on their literary works.

Library Society was also given the opportunity to work with a local Chinese author to create a virtual escape room website for one of her books. Our librarians were split up into various subgroups, namely the scriptwriters, actors, props, directors and questions and we all worked as best as we could to make this project a successful one.

One of our learning journeys this year was to the National Gallery of Singapore, where our librarians were able to learn more about the history and stories behind each artwork. Subsequently, the librarians worked in groups to pick out a book to recommend as well as artworks that were related to the plot.

Three lower secondary teams took part in English competitions organised by NLB. Our two teams did exceedingly well in Prove It! Contest 2023 and were awarded Gold for both video and written categories. The HSI Challenge 2023 team were awarded Silver for their video and report.

After receiving the CDAC awards last year, our members continued reading newspapers to the elderly at the CDAC centre in Ang Mo Kio every Thursday. This is the first year since the pandemic that we were able to resume in\-person sharing sessions, which provided the platform for more interactions with the elderly. We also ran 23 reading sessions in July as part of “Read for Books 2023” VIA organised by NLB aimed at raising awareness of reading and sharing the gift of reading so that books could be donated to less privileged children via The WondeRead initiative, Ready to Read @ NLB and kidsREAD.

Due to the ease of Covid-19 restrictions, we were able to work with other CCAs and we organised our very first St. Nick’s Poetry Slam Competition together with Chinese Drama Society, Literary Drama Society and Chinese Cultural Society where our 姐妹们 wrote and performed their own poems. Another collaboration was with Art Club and Green Club, where our librarians wrote poems or did up book reviews that tied in with the artworks that were on display. In consideration of our Primary 妹妹们, we sourced for several books that were suitable for them to read. We look forward to working with more CCAs to provide meaningful experiences to everyone in the school next year.

We also had a trip to Kinokuniya bookshop in Semester 2 where we had a thoroughly enjoyable time selecting new books from a wide range of genres for our library. Library Society is hopeful that we will have a ‘fun filled’ 2024 to hone our literary talents and develop us further as well-read young women.
