<i><b>**Library Society Website Report 2025**
"The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you’ll go." <br>- Dr. Seuss</b></i>

In 2025, Library Society embarked on a journey of new experiences. We had various highlights such as creating ‘BookTok’ videos (on the theme ‘Ink and Intrigue’) to publicise recommendations for the annual English Language and Literature Festival (_ELLF 2025_) on Instagram, as well as a workshop conducted by Mr José from the Embassy of Portugal in Singapore to discover the wonders of the culture of Portugal. Library Society also had the opportunity to take part in a workshop conducted by CIVICA called BAMM Imagination, ‘Books and Mind Meet Imagination’, with a focus on reading and fostering creative expression, which we thoroughly enjoyed.&nbsp; This was in addition to the EL and CL book presentations which we regularly carried out to foster a love of reading and publicise our selection of books with the school community.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Two lower secondary teams took part in the Prove It! Contest 2025 organised by National Library Board. The teams were tasked with publicising their content so as to educate others on media literacy and topics related to Cybersecurity and Green technology. We are proud to announce that both teams were awarded Silver at National level for their articles and videos.

Library Society offers a wide range of enriching VIA opportunities from Secondary 1 to 4. One key opportunity includes participating in the NLB’s annual Read for Books VIA, where books are donated to underprivileged communities through partner organisations. Librarians also take part in NLB storytelling sessions for children, where we engage young audiences through lively stories and encourage them to nurture a deeper appreciation for reading. In addition, librarians can also volunteer with NLB as ambassadors to educate the public about digital literacy during road shows.

We actively initiate collaborations with other CCAs to enrich our members’ experiences and foster stronger inter-CCA ties. We hosted a bonding session with Publications this year, where members from both CCAs had the opportunity to interact and learn more about each other’s CCA. We had a Blind Book Wrapping and Contexticles sharing which enhanced our learning and provided us the opportunity to form meaningful inter- CCA friendships.

This year we also had book presentations on the theme “_If I could end the story differently_…” where we shared our creative ideas as budding writers. Library Society is optimistic about the years ahead, and looks forward to organising even more engaging activities for our members. Who knows if a budding Nobel laureate writer may someday arise from among us….

As a CCA, we aim to create lasting memories as our members strive to grow to be well-read, gracious women of character.

<tr><td style="width:50%"><b>Prove It! Contest 2025 and Historical Scene Investigation (HSI) Challenge 2025 (EL NLB Competitions)</b><br><br>
Our two Lower Secondary teams were awarded Silver (Written Category) and Bronze (Video Category) in this contest organised by National Library Board. The Written Category team were required to write an article on their chosen topic of “Influencers and celebrities: “Are they a positive influence on teenagers?”. The team did extensive research, careful citations of sources, and meticulously crafted survey questions for data collection. The team had to present their article and research to the school as part of the competition’s requirements.<br><br>The Video Category team chose to create an engaging video regarding the same topic as the written category team, which garnered a Bronze award. The video was shared school-wide to create awareness of information literacy skills.
<br><br>Historical Scene Investigation (HSI) Challenge 2024 (EL NLB Competition)<br><br>
Two teams took part in this annual competition organised by the National Library Board - our teams won Bronze Awards for their videos and reports on Singapore’s post-independence policies and their impact on people then and now.</td>

Library Society visited Alliance Française de Singapour in March 2024, for a French lesson and tour. Led by Mr. Nikola, we practiced basic French conversation and learned about the origins of languages. The tour included La Médiathèque, a French library with over 17,000 books, a gallery honoring women athletes, and insights into cultural preservation. It was an enriching experience, fostering appreciation of the French language and culture.
<br><br>Librarians did a trip to Kinokuniya and Zall bookstore in August to purchase books for the school library.
<br><br>We selected a wide range of books from fiction to nonfiction and even had a delicious snack and juice session at Zall bookstore which was a small but quaint bookshop!</td>

Participants crafted poems based on assigned topics and presented them verbally to an audience. Audience votes and teacher judges determined the winning group based on poem content and delivery.

校园超级阅读明星比赛（Super Reading Star Competition）<br><br> 我们图书馆学会在2023和2024年代表学校参加了全国校园超级阅读明星比赛。我们发挥创意、一起合作，在2023年分别获得漫画组和故事视频组一、二等奖。在2024年也获得了最佳视频奖。通过，这次比赛，我们能把自己阅读书籍通过不同形式传达给大家，真是一次难得的体验。
<br><br>故事擂台挑战赛 (Chinese Storytelling Challenge)<br><br>	
我们图书馆学会每年都会有举办一些关于华文知识的小比赛。今年我们进行了故事擂台挑战赛 。大家四人为一组，只有两把椅子作为道具，我们要在短短 20 分钟内用到规定的词语和条件创作出一个小故事。然后，在大家面前表演前三分钟。这个游戏不仅有趣，还锻炼了我们的想象
力、团队合作能力、表演技巧、自信心和应变能力。
<br><br>黄谦教授精彩的文学讲座 (Chinese Poetry Workshop)<br><br>
今年，从中国远道而来的黄谦教授为我们带来了一场精彩的诗词讲座。他用独创的“无调唱法”和“楚调唐音唱法”为我们诠释了王安石的作品《元日》。听了他的讲解，姐妹们对中国文学更感兴趣了。通过唱歌学习古诗词比单纯背诵古诗词更有趣，也让我们对中国文化和历史有了更多的了解。

小书迷读书会讲故事 (little-avid-volunteer)<br>

今年2月，我校六位中三的学生参与了国家图书馆和推广华文理事会公同举办绘本导读工作坊。在此次培训中，她们学习了一些导读绘本的技巧，为接下来的义工活动做好了准备。
<br><br>她们在4月参加了&lt;小书迷和小小书迷\&gt;的义工活动。她们在活动前认真准备，并利用周末的时间去图书馆为小孩子们讲了有趣的故事，并耐心地教他们一起做手工，受到孩子和家长们的欢迎和好评。

通过这次愉快和难得的经验，同学们提高了讲华语的自信心，也学会了如何与他人沟通相处，跨出自己的舒适区，不断挑战自我。最重要的是明白了应该回馈社会，为有需要的人伸出援助之手。
