#### **Library Society**

In 2024, Library Society embarked on a journey of new experiences - we had various highlights such as creating ‘BookTok’ videos to publicise recommendations for the English Language and Literature Festival (ELLF 2024) on Instagram and also a translation workshop by The Little Entrepreneur to discover the wonders of language. Librarians explored books related to French culture and translation at the Alliance Française, where we learnt about the beauty of the French language and culture. We also had a workshop called BAMM Imagination, ‘Books and Mind Meet Imagination’ by CIVICA which focused on reading and creative expression, which we thoroughly enjoyed.

Library Society was also given the opportunity to attend a poetry workshop by a professor from China, where we learnt innovative ways to understand Chinese poems. To deepen our appreciation for Chinese culture, we subsequently watched the globally renowned Chinese movie ‘Hi, Mom’ which was sentimental, warm and showed a glimpse of what China was like in the 1960s.

One of our learning journeys this year was to the Alliance Française de Singapour, a cultural organization. We immersed ourselves in French culture and explored a gallery honouring French women athletes as well as a French Library. It was an enriching experience, fostering our appreciation for French language and culture.

Four lower secondary teams took part in English competitions organised by NLB in 2024. Our two teams did well in Prove It! Contest 2024 and were awarded Silver for Written and Bronze for the Video categories- they also had to publicise their content to the school as part of educating others on media literacy. The two HSI Challenge 2024 teams were awarded Bronze for their submissions.

Library Society provides us with many fruitful and enriching VIA opportunities from the secondary one to secondary four levels. Every year, we read newspapers to the elderly community at CDAC@Ang Mo Kio, and actively interact with them to bring them joy. We also did the NLB Read for Books 2024 in July, which was a VIA activity that enabled books to be donated to the less fortunate through various organisations. Librarians often participate in NLB storytelling events for kids, where we engage with children through lively stories and nurture a love for reading, making it a fulfilling experience for both parties. Some of us signed up with NLB on a voluntary basis for a VIA stint as VIA ambassadors to educate the public during road shows about information literacy.

We had collaborations across CCAs, such as organising a Poetry Slam competition, which was a CCA collaboration event with Chinese Drama Society, as well as an inter-CCA exchange bonding session with Publications. Students in our school had the chance to participate in the Poetry Slam competition and hone their CL poetry and drama skills. We also had a collaboration with Green Club and were able to create bookmarks together, as well as have an enjoyable bonding session with Publications in February this year where members from both CCAs interacted and learned about each other’s CCA. These activities helped us further enrich our CCA sessions and enabled us to make new friends across several CCAs.

Lastly, we went on a learning journey to two different bookstores in August. We learned about interesting places in Singapore, picked up new books for ourselves and the school library, and had a whale of a time. We visited Kinokuniya at Takashimaya and Zall, the Chinese bookstore where we had a workshop to strengthen our bilingualism and encourage a love for Chinese books.

Library Society is optimistic that we will have even more interesting activities next year, and looks forward to creating bright memories, with all our members growing to be well-read, erudite girls of grace.

Our two Lower Secondary teams were awarded Silver (Written Category) and Bronze (Video Category) in this contest organised by National Library Board. The Written Category team were required to write an article on their chosen topic of “Influencers and celebrities: “Are they a positive influence on teenagers?”. The team did extensive research, careful citations of sources, and meticulously crafted survey questions for data collection. The team had to present their article and research to the school as part of the competition’s requirements.<br><br>The Video Category team chose to create an engaging video regarding the same topic as the written category team, which garnered a Bronze award. The video was shared school-wide to create awareness of information literacy skills.

Library Society visited Alliance Française de Singapour in March 2024, for a French lesson and tour. Led by Mr. Nikola, we practiced basic French conversation and learned about the origins of languages. The tour included La Médiathèque, a French library with over 17,000 books, a gallery honoring women athletes, and insights into cultural preservation. It was an enriching experience, fostering appreciation of the French language and culture.
<br><br>Librarians did a trip to Kinokuniya and Zall bookstore in August to purchase books for the school library.
<br><br>We selected a wide range of books from fiction to nonfiction and even had a delicious snack and juice session at Zall bookstore which was a small but quaint bookshop!</td>

We did a fill-in-the-blank poem, writing a haiku inspired by trash and crafting a poem about a plant’s life, as told from its point of view. All of which truly unlocked our inner poets!</td>
