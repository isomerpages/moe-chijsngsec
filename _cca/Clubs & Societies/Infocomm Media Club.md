<p>SNGS Infocomm Media Club offers students a dynamic and engaging platform
to explore the world of technology, media, and communication. As part of
the club, students gain hands-on experience in various aspects of Infocomm
technology, such as coding, digital media creation, video production and
graphic design. Through workshops, projects, and competitions, members
can develop critical skills in problem-solving, creativity, and collaboration.
The club encourages students to harness technology not only as a tool for
innovation but also to create meaningful impact in their communities.</p>
<p>SNGS Infocomm Media Club aims to develop students’ skills and character
through service to the school community. Members take on important roles
such as photography and videography for school events, ensuring moments
are captured and shared. They also engage in coding projects, enhancing
their technical expertise, and support school programmes through public
announcement duties. By participating in these meaningful responsibilities,
students not only sharpen their Infocomm skills but also contribute to
the smooth running and vibrancy of school life, embodying a spirit of service
and teamwork.</p>
