#### **Art Club**

<img src="/images/06%20CCA/CS%20Art%20Club/Picture63.jpg" style="width:75%">

Serving as a platform for members to express their artistic flair and creative talents, Art Club strongly values each and every member and their artistic capabilities and contributions, welcoming all students who are passionate about art with open arms.
<br><br>Art Club oversees the maintenance of our school’s ‘Doodle Wall’. It is regularly updated to welcome and showcase upcoming school events, also inviting members to freely exercise their skills and creativity.
<br><br>We participate in many events annually, such as Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and Live On Festival Design Competition. Moreover, not forgetting our duty to serve, we actively give back to the community through community projects with community centers and hospitals while learning about the needs and challenges faced by others. In addition, we also regularly collaborate with fellow peers in initiating community projects to inspire others through positive actions to address real world social issues and to develop empathy for the needy. Through these initiatives, we continuously develop our members’ technical competency and efficiency, while also cultivating a spirit of collaboration and teamwork.<br>
<br>Art Club will strive to continue to be a place where young artists can grow and hone their skills in the creative arts.
