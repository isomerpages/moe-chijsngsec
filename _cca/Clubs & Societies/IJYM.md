<tr><td style="width:50%"><b>Beekind</b><br><br>Beekind is a programme started by IJYM where we plan initiatives that benefit the community, whether it is the elderly, young children, our primary section 妹妹们, and even our own schoolmates. One of our Beekind initiatives was the Valentine’s Day recess booth, where we taught our schoolmates how to make pipe cleaner crafts in theme for Valentine’s Day and Chinese New Year. Another of our initiatives is Peer Tutoring, where we pair the upper secondary students with lower secondary students for tutoring in various subjects to promote our school’s 姐妹同心 spirit. This year we also launched the Borrow An Umbrella campaign, which seeks to help provide students with umbrellas on rainy days.<br>
