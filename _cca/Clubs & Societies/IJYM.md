<tr><td style="width:50%"><b>IJHCC Joint IJYM Carnival</b><br><br>To celebrate the 170th anniversary of CHIJ in 2024, the 5 IJYM clubs collaborated to host children from The Infant Jesus Homes and Children’s Centres (IJHCC) at our school for a fun-packed carnival. Together with our IJYM counterparts we set up various game booths for the delighted children of IJHCC. The carnival was a huge success, and we ended the day singing ‘Hold On to Our Dreams’ together.<br>

It is a meaningful culmination that every member looks forward to as everyone works effortlessly together to reflect on our journey as a CCA for the year and creatively capture the various ways we have tried to live out our mission. We are pleased to announce that we have achieved the Distinction Award again as we presented on the theme of Light in Darkness.<br></td>

We organise activities such as karaoke, game sessions and simple arts and crafts projects to keep them active and facilitate meaningful interaction with them. We also take turns to visit Onesimus Centre in smaller groups each Tuesday to conduct active-ageing activities for the elderly in the early stages of dementia in the hope of enriching their lives.<br>
