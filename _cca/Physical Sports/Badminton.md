Badminton is a fun game that everyone enjoys and has definitely played before. It helps you to build up your fitness, and helps hone and develop one‚Äôs skills to better enjoy the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Here at St. Nicks, we have supportive team members that encourages everyone and cheers each other on. Especially when the going gets tough as we strive onwards together.&nbsp;  

Our teachers and coaches are caring and approachable and often provides us feedback and to help us improve.&nbsp;&nbsp;  

Training encompasses fitness training, skills techniques and the occasional game to bond with one another. All one needs is an open mind and an ever ready-to-learn spirit to have a blast in Badminton üè∏&nbsp;  

SNBT All the way!
