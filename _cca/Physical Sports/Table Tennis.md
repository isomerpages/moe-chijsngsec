The St. Nicholas Girls' Table Tennis team (SNTT) has demonstrated remarkable success in inter-school competitions over recent years. Our team trained with commitment, even through holidays, to prepare for these events. With unwavering perseverance and spirit, they consistently showcased sportsmanship and determination, always putting in their best effort.<br><br>
In SNTT, members have a variety of opportunities to develop character and leadership skills. Through competitions, exchanges, and rigorous training, the team builds self-discipline, resilience, and confidence. Additional platforms, such as the annual sports camp and organizing VIA activities, further support their growth in leadership abilities.
