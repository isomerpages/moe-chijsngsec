<tr><td style="width:50%"><b>B Division 2024</b><br><br>Passion. Grit. Strength. These are the qualities that we uphold as we work as one to achieve our common goal. No matter how gruelling training gets, overcoming it is just a matter of time for our close-knit family. The positive learning environment enables each and every one of our members to offer and receive constructive feedback to constantly improve and strive for the best. These are the experiences that have enabled us to grow physically and mentally as a team.<br><br>
It has been an enriching experience for us captains to have led the team. These achievements would not have been possible without the unwavering support of our coach, teachers and teammates. We are confident that SNNB will continue to grow as a team, a family and into the beasts we envision it to be.</td>

<tr><td style="width:50%"><b>C Division 2024</b><br><br>It has been a fruitful season for us. We, as the C division batch of SNNB 2024, strive to achieve the best results through NSG; overcoming all our tough obstacles together. Although this year's NSG format was different and unique, i.e., having to go againt the strong opponents from the get-go, we did not back down from the tough matches but pushed through with resilience and grit.<br><br>
Although the journey was arduous, with the guidance and never-ending support, guidance and encouragements from our coach, teachers and our seniors, we have pushed through all the tough and tiring moments together. We are immensely grateful for our coach and teachers for never giving up on us and for our seniors for always having our back - being there for us always. As a SNNB family, we will always stick together and hold one another as a big part of our lives.</td>
