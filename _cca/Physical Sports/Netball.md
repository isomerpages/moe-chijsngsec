<tr><td style="width:50%"><b>B Division 2024</b><br><br>Passion. Grit. Strength. These are the qualities that we uphold as we work as one to achieve our common goal. No matter how gruelling training gets, overcoming it is just a matter of time for our close-knit family. The positive learning environment enables each and every one of our members to offer and receive constructive feedback to constantly improve and strive for the best. These are the experiences that have enabled us to grow physically and mentally as a team.<br><br>
It has been an enriching experience for us captains to have led the team. These achievements would not have been possible without the unwavering support of our coach, teachers and teammates. We are confident that SNNB will continue to grow as a team, a family and into the beasts we envision it to be.</td>

<tr><td style="width:50%"><b>C Division 2023</b><br><br>As a whole SNNB, we strive to embody the spirit of the ‘SNNB Beast’, where we resiliently bounce back after every setback. Through the constant guidance and support from our coach and teachers, we continuously grow to become stronger versions of ourselves. Although training during the NSG season may be tiring, we look forward to them as it is a chance for us to come up with strategies to play in our next competition.<br><br>
We are immensely grateful for the opportunity to bring glory to our school. We will continue to work hard in preparation for the next round of NSG. We are extremely thankful to our coach and teachers, as well as the whole SNNB family, for their constant support and encouragement. Truly, SNNB is a family to us, and will continue to hold a special place in our hearts.</td>
