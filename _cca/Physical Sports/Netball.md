#### **CCA Highlights**

<table style="width:100%">

<tr><td style="width:50%"><b>B Division 2025</b><br><br>"SNNB Beast!" is our cheer at the start of every single NSG match. Through the regular morning jogs before school and every gruelling training session, we persisted, prevailed and ultimately grew physically and mentally as a close-knit team. With every match we played, we pushed ourselves and played to the final whistle. Our season was filled with ups and downs, with each game testing our mental fortitude and resilience. While each win raised the team’s morale and spirits, each setback motivated us to come back stronger, fully embodying our "beast" spirit.

As captains of 2025 B Division, we are extremely grateful for the opportunity to lead this team and represent our school. We are also extremely thankful to our teachers and teammates for their immense support and encouragement. To us, SNNB is more than just a "CCA", it is a place where we find lifelong friends while cultivating our passion for netball, develop ourselves holistically and a place that will forever hold a special place in our hearts.</td>

<tr><td style="width:50%"><b>C Division 2024</b><br><br>This year’s National School Games was truly eventful and memorable for all of us. Despite facing challenges such as injuries during the season, we stood strong, persevered, and supported one another both on and off the court. We are deeply grateful to our coach for her invaluable guidance, and to our teachers for their unwavering encouragement. A special thanks also goes to our SNNB family and parent supporters, whose cheers lifted us through every match.

We are immensely proud of our team for fighting from the first whistle to the last. Even in the face of tough competition, our spirits remained unbroken as we played with pride for the glory of SN. The journey of 2025 was not only fulfilling but also deeply meaningful, reminding us of the values we hold dear—perseverance, self-belief, unity, and our unyielding “beast” spirit. These will forever remain an enduring part of our identity.</td>
