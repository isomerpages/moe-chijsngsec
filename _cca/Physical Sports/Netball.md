#### **CCA Highlights**

<tr><td style="width:50%"><b>B Division 2025</b><br><br>"SNNB Beast!" is our cheer at the start of every single NSG match. Through the regular morning jogs before school and every gruelling training session, we persisted, prevailed and ultimately grew physically and mentally as a close-knit team. With every match we played, we pushed ourselves and played to the final whistle. Our season was filled with ups and downs, with each game testing our mental fortitude and resilience. While each win raised the team’s morale and spirits, each setback motivated us to come back stronger, fully embodying our "beast" spirit.

As captains of 2025 B Division, we are extremely grateful for the opportunity to lead this team and represent our school. We are also extremely thankful to our teachers and teammates for their immense support and encouragement. To us, SNNB is more than just a "CCA", it is a place where we find lifelong friends while cultivating our passion for netball, develop ourselves holistically and a place that will forever hold a special place in our hearts.</td>

<tr><td style="width:50%"><b>C Division 2024</b><br><br>It has been a fruitful season for us. We, as the C division batch of SNNB 2024, strive to achieve the best results through NSG; overcoming all our tough obstacles together. Although this year's NSG format was different and unique, i.e., having to go againt the strong opponents from the get-go, we did not back down from the tough matches but pushed through with resilience and grit.<br><br>
Although the journey was arduous, with the guidance and never-ending support, guidance and encouragements from our coach, teachers and our seniors, we have pushed through all the tough and tiring moments together. We are immensely grateful for our coach and teachers for never giving up on us and for our seniors for always having our back - being there for us always. As a SNNB family, we will always stick together and hold one another as a big part of our lives.</td>
