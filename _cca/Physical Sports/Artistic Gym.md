#### **Artistic Gym**

<img src="/images/06%20CCA/PS%20AGym/Picture1B.jpg" style="width:100%">

Artistic Gymnastics is a sport where gymnasts compete by doing short routines on four apparatus: balance beam, uneven bars, vault and floor exercise. In Trampoline, gymnasts perform acrobatic moves while bouncing on a trampoline. These sports are known for their artistry and grace which require gymnasts to display exceptional balance, strength and flexibility.  
  
Besides training for competitions, our gymnasts are exposed to a wide range of activities that allow them to interact socially to develop holistically. These activities include an annual sports camp, VIA activities, CCA fair and the School Open House. Through such activities, our gymnasts develop and display teamwork and creativity, as well as compassion and empathy. Gymnastics is not all about winning but displaying good sportsmanship. It is about developing resilience and a positive attitude that will empower our gymnasts in the future. This is exemplified through their willingness to devote long training hours to hone their skills to perfection.
