### **Humanities**

In today’s increasingly interconnected and unpredictable world, Humanities education plays an undeniably instrumental role in empowering our students with the necessary knowledge and skills to navigate the modern terrain. Through a multidisciplinary approach across the subjects of Geography, History and Social Studies, you will develop a keenly inquisitive disposition alongside a sense of empathy and critical appreciation for the environment and people around you.

#### **Our Curriculum**  

The Humanities curriculum is centered on interdisciplinary thinking which enables you to draw connections and apply integrated skills within and beyond the classroom. Through exploration and critical consideration of alternative perspectives about complex and authentic issues, you will be able to deepen your sense of appreciation and empathy for people and the environment, while developing a confident personal voice. As you reflect on your own beliefs, values and thinking, you will construct your own understanding of the world, thus playing an active role in imagining and shaping the future.
