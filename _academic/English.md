<b>Our Philosophy</b>   

Words have power. We strive to develop our students to become effective, eloquent and empathetic communicators so that they can harness the power of words in various contexts, to positively influence the world around them. We also seek to inspire appreciation, understanding and passion for language, through the study of English Language and Literature.   
  
<b>Our Approach</b>   

Thinking, writing and reading critically are essential skills for the 21st century. Students apply these skills as they engage in discussions on complex issues and texts both within and beyond the classroom. They are exposed to a wide range of texts to enable them to develop new ways of perceiving the world around them. Students are also given opportunities to present their thoughts and views to others, in order to develop their confidence in public speaking.  
  
<b>Our Signature Programmes</b>   

*   Secondary 1 English Speech Enrichment   
The Secondary 1 English Speech Enrichment programme seeks to develop students’ confidence and equip them with skills and techniques necessary for effective communication and presentation. Students learn how to write a persuasive speech effectively before presenting their speeches to the class for assessment. The best speaker represents the class in the annual ELLF interclass speech competition.   
  

*   Secondary 2 Drama Enrichment   
The Secondary 2 Drama Enrichment programme seeks to equip students with fundamental public speaking skills and the basics of stagecraft. Students deepen their understanding of drama and gain exposure to the world of Shakespeare and his works.  
  

*   English Language and Literature Festival (ELLF)   
ELLF takes place in April each year. Throughout the week, students are exposed to a wide range of activities such as workshops, inter-class speech competitions and literary competitions. Students also have the opportunity to plan and execute their very own English and Literature activities.  
  

*   Creative Writing Circle   
Our school-based writing circle seeks to develop, inspire and empower students who have an interest in creative writing. It involves seminar discussions with local poets or writers who share their approach and inspiration behind their creative pieces, and tips on writing. Students are given time to work on creative writing pieces which are submitted for critique by local writers.   
  

*   Humanities Talent Development Programme (HTDP)   
Our school-based HTDP seeks to develop students who have the passion and desire to pursue the Humanities in greater depth and exposure. Students are given opportunities to broaden their exposure of the Humanities, and undertake a Humanities Research Study under the close guidance of mentors.   
  

*   N6 Cluster Literature Events   
As the Centre of Excellence for English, we organise annual cluster events such as the ‘Tea, Tiffin and Poetry’ to inspire students to love poetry, read poetry and write their own poems.
