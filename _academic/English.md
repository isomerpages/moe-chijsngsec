### **English**
Words have power. We strive to develop you to become effective, eloquent and empathetic communicators so that you can harness the power of words in various contexts, to positively influence the people around you. We also seek to inspire appreciation, understanding and passion for language, through the study of English Language and Literature.

  
#### **Our Curriculum**  

Thinking, writing and reading critically are essential skills for the 21st century. You will apply these skills as you engage in discussions on complex issues and texts both within and beyond the classroom. You are exposed to a wide range of texts to enable you to develop new ways of perceiving your world. You are also given opportunities to present your thoughts and views to others, in order to develop your confidence in public speaking.

Our school-based writing circle seeks to develop, inspire and empower students who have an interest in creative writing.
