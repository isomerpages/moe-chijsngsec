Table Tennis
============

The St Nicholas Girlsâ€™ Table Tennis team (SNTT) has achieved excellent results at inter-school competitions in the last few years. Our team trained hard even during the holidays in preparation for the competitions and faced many challenges along the way. As a team, they demonstrated sportsmanship and determination, overcoming all challenges while putting in their best.

  

In SNTT, there are various opportunities and platforms to develop character and leadership. Through table tennis competitions, exchanges and trainings, the team develops self-discipline, resilience and confidence. Other platforms like the annual sports camp and organizing VIA activities also serve well to develop leadership skills.
