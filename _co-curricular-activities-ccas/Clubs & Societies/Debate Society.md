Debate Society
==============

<img src="/images/Debate%20Society.jpeg" style="width:80%">

    The most important tactic in an argument, next to being right, is to leave an escape hatch for your opponent, so that he can gracefully swing over to your side without an embarrassing loss of face.

<i>\- American Journalist, Sydney J. Harris</i>

  

    Whether as an abstract construct or as the constructed exercise with strict rules and format, debate remains a useful and valuable tool in your learning. The Debate Society endeavours to train you to focus clearly on an issue at hand, undistracted by the tangential or the seemingly fashionable. You will hone your confidence in the eloquent expression of your considered opinion backed by credible information and knowledge in a myriad of debating opportunities.
