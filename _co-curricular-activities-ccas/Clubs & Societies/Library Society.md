Library Society
===============


<img src="/images/Library%20Society.jpeg" style="width:80%">


   Library Society aspires to spread the joy of reading with our fellow 姐妹们 and also encourages them to read more widely. We work closely with the National Library Board (NLB) and participate in competitions such as HSI Challenge and VIA activities, such as Read for Books Charity Drive. Additionally, this year we have also taken part in competitions run by other organisations such as the Greenreads Haiku Competition. Every Wednesday and Friday, we gather in the library to take part in various language-related activities.

  

    We strive to promote a love for languages and reading among students, through book sharing activities and various oral presentations in both English and Mandarin. In 2022, we expanded the scope of our activities to become more involved in the annual Mother Tongue Fortnight and English Language and Literature Festival (ELLF) organised by our school. We produced a virtual escape room for our 姐妹们 to participate in during the Mother Tongue Fortnight, as well as a Kahoot quiz for ELLF 2022 and shared IG posts on EL book reviews.

  

    Our experiences in Library Society have not only enabled us to apply our prior knowledge to our classwork but have also taught us transferable skills such as creative writing and public speaking that will benefit us in the future.

  

    Library Society also takes part in annual Values-in-Action (VIA) programmes such as Chinese Newspaper reading sessions to the elderly at the Chinese Development Assistance Council (CDAC) Centre in Ang Mo Kio. In 2022, our school was presented with the 5-Year Partnership Award as well as the Outstanding Partnership Award by CDAC. It was a fruitful experience for the librarians as they got to interact with the elderly as well as gain soft skills like speaking in front of an audience.

  

    As librarians, we strive to continuously improve the image of the library and ensure that it remains a conducive study environment for our schoolmates. In addition, our school librarian helps us set up interesting book displays and eye-catching information booths on festivals and current issues. We make annual visits to bookshops such as Zall bookstore to get inspiration to beautify our own library, as well as to replenish our supply of carefully selected books in the library to cater to our students’ taste. This year, we also helped in developing a booking system for the discussion rooms in our library during the gradual reopening of our library to the general school population after COVID-19 restrictions were lifted. Our attractive discussion rooms are well utilized by both staff and students and provide a calm space for collaborative work.

  

    To conclude, a quote by Marcus Tullius Cicero: “A room without books is like a body without a soul.” Time spent in the Library Society is truly time that is cherished by all our members.
