Literary Drama Society
======================


<img src="/images/Literary%20Drama%20Society.jpeg" style="width:80%">

The Literary Drama Society (LDS) provides a platform for our members to convey their thoughts and ideas through the theatrical arts, writing and performing our very own pieces of plays and poetry.  
  
Every year, we go on an exhilarating roller coaster ride of new experiences that help shape our identity, with the hard work and dedication of each and every member contributing to our CCA’s success. Together, we will strive to bring LD to greater heights!
