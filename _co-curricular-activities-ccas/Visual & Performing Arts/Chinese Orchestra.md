Chinese Orchestra
=================


Inaugurated in 1992, St. Nicholas Chinese Orchestra (SNCO) started off with a few individuals interested in certain instruments. Initially, there were only dizi and pipa classes.

  

Gradually, interest spread and a few enthusiastic girls sent a proposal to the principal Mrs Hwang-Lee Poh See to start a Chinese Orchestra as a Co-Curricular Activity, backing their plan up with the reason that St Nicholas was a Chinese school. From the small handful of students, our orchestra has expanded to its current 70 odd members.

  

Some of the orchestraâ€™s key objectives are to promote the awareness and appreciation of Chinese music, as well as to exchange ideas and experiences among musically-oriented institutions and individuals. We also felt that there was a need to take an active interest in the civic, cultural, and general welfare of the Chinese and wider community.

  

Under the guidance of our teachers, instructors and the baton of Mr Liu Bin, a renowned composer and conductor, the orchestra has been steadily improving. SNCO is also continually working to develop the group's repertoire and technical capabilities, to foster new audiences, as well as recruit and train new members.
