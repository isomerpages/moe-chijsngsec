Symphonic Band
==============


The CHIJ St Nicholas Girls' School symphonic band was established in 1972. It has since evolved from a regimental marching band to a versatile performance band.

  

We are a 90-member strong band under the baton of Ms Sia Swee Suan, our band conductor, and perform a wide variety of pieces ranging from pop music to classical music. The band performs regularly for morning assemblies, school concerts and participates in national and international competitions, obtaining many awards in the process.

  

In the 2021 SYF Arts Presentation, we obtained a Certificate of Distinction and a Certificate of Accomplishment. The band has a track record of excellence; we were awarded a Certificate of Distinction in the 2019 SYF Arts Presentation, and a Certificate of Distinction in the 2017 SYF Arts Presentation.
