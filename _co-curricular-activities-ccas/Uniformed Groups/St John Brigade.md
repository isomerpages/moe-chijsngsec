St John Brigade
===============


<img src="/images/SJB.jpeg" style="width:80%">


St John Brigade (SJB) Singapore seeks to instil self-discipline in students and to promote teamwork among students.   
  
Students will learn basic first aid knowledge, which includes Home Nursing and Basic/Advanced CPR techniques. They will also engage in vigorous foot-drill and physical training sessions to build up their stamina. Students then apply the skills learnt in Zonal and National Competitions, which are held every year.  
  
Our motto is _Pro Utilitate Hominum_ (For The Service of Mankind) and this is instilled in the cadets as they engage in Public Duty services, where they apply their practical skills into real-world context. Our cadets have provided first aid and relief efforts at numerous school events as well as various national platforms.
