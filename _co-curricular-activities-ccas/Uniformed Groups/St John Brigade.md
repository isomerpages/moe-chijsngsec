St John Brigade
===============


<img src="/images/SJB.jpeg" style="width:80%">


St John Brigade (SJB) Singapore seeks to instil self-discipline in students and to promote teamwork among students.   
  
Students will learn basic first aid knowledge, which includes Home Nursing and Basic/Advanced CPR techniques. They will also engage in vigorous foot-drill and physical training sessions to build up their stamina. Students then apply the skills learnt in Zonal and National Competitions, which are held every year.  
  
Our motto is _Pro Utilitate Hominum_ (For The Service of Mankind) and this is instilled in the cadets as they engage in Public Duty services, where they apply their practical skills into real-world context. Our cadets have provided first aid and relief efforts at numerous school events as well as various national platforms.   
  
<b>The St John Pledge</b>:  
  
<i>To be loyal to Singapore and the President of the Republic   
To upkeep the honour and dignity of the Brigade and my Country   
To observe the mottoes of the Order, which are "Pro Fide" – For the Faith, "Pro Utilitate Hominum" – For the Service of Mankind   
To be loyal to the Chief Commissioner and all my Officers   
To read the Brigade Regulations and to comply with them in all respects   
To carry out all orders received from time to time from seniors   
To carry out my duties with zeal and efficiency to the best of my ability   
To be courteous and honest in all my words and actions</i>
