Girl Guides
===========


<img src="/images/Girl%20Guides.jpeg" style="width:80%">

Girl Guides @ SN aims to prepare guides to handle challenges and new situations with a sense of confidence and self-assuredness. Through the 5-Point Programme and various proficiency/interest badges, guides are able to develop their leadership, decision-making and team-building skills.

  
<b>Guide Motto:</b>  
Be Prepared  
  
<b>Guide Promise:</b>      
I promise to do my best;  
To do my duty to God,  
To serve my country and help other people, and  
To keep the Guide Law
