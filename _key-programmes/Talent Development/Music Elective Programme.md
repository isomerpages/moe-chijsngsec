The Music Elective Programme (MEP) is a four-year programme which provides opportunities for musically-inclined students to pursue a deeper study and practice in music. Through the programme, students will have the opportunity to learn more about a range of music across genres and cultures, including Asian, Classical, Jazz and Popular Music.  
  
Students selected for the programme will be equipped with skills for music analysis, aural perception, composition and performance. They will share rich classroom experiences aimed at nurturing a deeper appreciation of music with like-minded peers, and be offered exciting opportunities such as interaction with composers, master classes and workshops, in order to deepen their learning.   
  
The programme prepares students for the GCE ‘O’ Level Higher Music Examination, which can be considered in place of a Humanities subject for Junior College admission.
